### 👋🏻 About Me
I am a software developer working in the automotive industry. Alongside developing touchscreen interfaces for premium cars, I get involved in project engineering and software testing. Outside of work I have some web-based side projects, which you will find here on GitHub. I am from Coventry in the United Kingdom, where I live with my wife and two sons.

### 🛠 Tools
My stack is HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap for the frontend and PHP, MySQL and Laravel for the backend. Wordpress is my CMS of choice and I am also an AWS Certified Practitioner.
